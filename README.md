# Intro To Bioinformatics
A collection of beginner resources

Hi, I'm a junior bioinformatics analyst. 
I'm currently working on developing and sharing resources to help other bioinformaticians.

What is Bioinformatics?
-----------------------

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that pulls knowledge of computer science, mathematics, and biology in order to use computational tools to solve biological problems. 
Most biology domains use bioinformatics.

Where to Start
--------------

_Biology or Computer Science?_

Ask yourself: are you a biologist who enjoys coding or a computer scientist who enjoys biology? 
This will dictate where you start.

For myself, I fall into the former category as I did my undergrad in Biology and minored in Computer Studies. I did a lot of organismal biology actually, so if you're like me: 

I would advise starting with learning how to code. Depending on your lab, you'll probably be coding in R, Python, or a combination of both. 
You may be using GUI (graphical user interfaces) to run your analyses (such as Galaxy) or you may do them in the terminal. For the latter, you probably will have to learn Bash and the command line.
  
1. **Learn to code**

  Starting with understanding the basics of Bash would be great because usually universities have some sort of HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster set up. 
  It's like a bunch of computers ("cores", "cpus") that are located elsewhere ("server"). If you're able to use a HPC you'll be able to access additional memory (power/speed), disk space (space for your files), and modules
  (applications you can use without downloading them). The caveat of these HPCs is usually there's no GUI so you'll have to learn how to read, write, and execute files in a less decorative way than you're used to.

2. **Learn the biology**

   Choose a field of biology that interests you. From there, ask google (or ChatGPT) what are some ways that this field uses bioinformatics. Then ask it what are the tools they use to analyze their data.
   Look at journals and read papers about your topic/field. Some journals that are popular for Bioinformatics include:

   - Briefings in Bioinformatics: https://academic.oup.com/bib
   - PLOS Computational Biology: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/
   - BMC Bioinformatics: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/

   I'll link some papers below that would be good "starter" papers, because it's really hard to figure out how to read one!
   
4. **Learn the bioinformatics tools**

   Reading the whitepages is your best friend. Some tools have wonderful documentation, some don't. Try and stick to the ones that do (they usually are popular!)

5. **Learn how to interpret figures**

   This one is really hard! There are a lot of figures and usually we don't know which ones are giving us the best type of data!
   When I explain a figure, typically I'll follow this method: axes, colors/shapes, trend, interpretation
   
7. **Learn how to use a workflow manager**

   I use Snakemake.
